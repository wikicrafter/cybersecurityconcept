## Network Security

Network security focuses on protecting the usability, reliability, integrity, and safety of network and data. It involves both hardware and software technologies to enforce security measures across the network.
Key components of network security include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, virtual private networks (VPNs), and encryption. These tools help in preventing unauthorized access, detecting and blocking malicious activities, and ensuring secure communication over the network. Additionally, network security also involves implementing strong authentication methods and regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. Understanding network security is crucial for ensuring the overall security posture of an organization's IT infrastructure.
