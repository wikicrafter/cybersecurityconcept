## Incident Response Planning

Incident response planning is a crucial component of cybersecurity that focuses on preparing for and responding to security incidents. It involves creating a systematic approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack.
Incident response planning typically includes establishing an incident response team, documenting procedures for identifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents, as well as conducting regular training and exercises to ensure preparedness. The key goal is to minimize the impact of security incidents, reduce recovery time, and maintain business operations continuity. By creating and regularly updating an incident response plan, organizations can effectively mitigate risks and strengthen their overall cybersecurity posture.
