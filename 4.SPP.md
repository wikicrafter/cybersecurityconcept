## Security Policies and Procedures

Security policies and procedures are essential components of a robust cybersecurity framework. Security policies outline the rules and guidelines for securely accessing and using an organization's IT resources, while procedures provide the specific steps to follow in order to adhere to these policies.
Effective security policies address areas such as data protection, access control, incident response, and compliance with regulations. Procedures complement these policies by detailing the specific actions that employees, IT staff, and other stakeholders must take to maintain security. Regular review and updates to security policies and procedures are crucial to adapt to evolving threats and technology. This ensures that the organization is well-prepared to mitigate potential cybersecurity risks and maintain a strong security posture.
