## Cyber Threat Intelligence

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of information about potential threats targeting an organization. By gathering data from various sources, including open-source intelligence, dark web monitoring, and external feeds, CTI allows organizations to proactively identify and respond to potential cyber threats. This proactive approach enables organizations to better understand the motivation, capability, and intent of threat actors, ultimately enhancing their ability to protect their assets and systems.
CTI provides valuable insights into the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by threat actors, helping organizations to build robust defense mechanisms. It also facilitates informed decision-making, risk management, and the prioritization of resources to mitigate specific threats. By leveraging CTI, organizations can stay ahead of evolving cyber threats and bolster their overall cybersecurity posture.
